# Envision

## Introduction:
This application allows you to experiment with different color schemes and see how they look together in real-time. Whether you are a designer looking to create a cohesive palette for your latest project or a homeowner trying to find the perfect paint colors for your living room, this application will help you visualize how it looks which just a few clicks. Finding real-time area is also supported. 

## How it works: 
-> CANNY EDGE DETECTION 

-> FLOOD FILLING (BFS Approach) 

-> MASK ENHANCEMENT (3x3 min and 9x9 max filters to smoothen out edges)

-> APLHA BLENDING 

For area, asking user to provide reference length on the image using which area per pixel is calculated. Then summation pixel color swapped * area per pixel is used to find out the area of the region color swapped.   

## Use Case # 1:
A painting company can use it to: 

``Interior design``: can be used to help homeowners and interior designers select colors for a room or an entire house. The application can allow users to upload a photo of a room and then "paint" the walls, floor, and other surfaces with different colors to see how the room would look before any actual painting is done.

``Painting and architecture``: can be used by painters and architects to experiment with different color schemes for building exteriors and other large-scale structures.

``Cost Calculation``: the area calculated by application can be used to give an estimate of the cost of the painting, saving a lot of time. 

## Use Case # 2:
An ecommerce website that sells paint or other home improvement products can use application to enhance the customer experience and drive sales. Here are a few ways this can be done:

``Virtual Room Designer``: The application can allow customers to upload a photo of a room they want to paint and then experiment with different colors and paint types to see what the room will look like before they make a purchase. This can help customers make more informed decisions about their paint choices and increase their confidence in their purchase.

``Color Matching``: The application can be integrated with the website's product catalog, allowing customers to take a photo of a color they see in another setting, such as on a piece of furniture or in nature, and the application will match the color to the closest paint shades and provide details such as product name and price.

``Save and Share``: The application can allow customers to save and share the virtual room designs they create. This can allow them to easily share their design with friends and family or with a professional designer to get feedback or make suggestions.

``Color Palette``: The application can allow customers to create color palettes and save them for future use. They can also browse pre-existing color palettes created by design experts and other users to get inspiration for their project.
``Special Offers``: The application can provide personalized offers to the customers based on their selection like a bundle of rollers, brushes etc. or a discount on their paint purchase.

Integrating a wall painting application on an ecommerce website can help to increase customer engagement and drive sales by making it easier for customers to visualize the end result of their home improvement projects and make more informed decisions about their paint choices.
